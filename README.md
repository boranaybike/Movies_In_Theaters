# Movies_In_Theaters
Website project created with **Django** that shows the movies in the theaters.<br>
## In the project,<br>
There is a **homepage** with the movies in theaters (**members can comment and rate**), there is the **old movies page** with the movies that are no longer in the theaters
(the movies are taken from the api, the movies that are not coming from the api anymore show on this page). Both pages have their own **searching feature**. 
In addition, there are the detail pages of the movies, the profile **pages of the members**, and the **sign up** page. There are also **login log-out** features in the project 
and **members can follow each other**.<br>
Content of **movie detail page**: movie name-image-description, comments and ratings(stars) from members<br>
Content of **profile page**: profile photo-nickname, **followers-following**, **member's comments and ratings**, **edit profile**
